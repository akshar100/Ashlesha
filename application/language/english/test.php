$lang['about_text']="E-Yantra is an initiative by MHRD and IIT Bombay to improve the quality of robotics and
embedded systems education in the country. Project E-Yantra was conceptualized by Prof
Kavi Arya and Prof. Krithi Ramamritham, at IIT Bombay. Prof. Arya is the overall coordinator
(Principal Investigator) of this project. This project came out of their years of experience
in teaching the Embedded Systems course to students both at IIT-Bombay and at remote
engineering colleges through the Distance Education Program of IIT-Bombay.
      
      
      
       We found it easy to teach concepts to local students through hands-on work in the lab. The same
task was much more difficult with remote students having questionable access to labs with more
questionable supervision. We started to work on the concept of a “lab-in-a-box”.
      
      
      
       After a number of trials and errors we have converged onto the given Firebird series of robots
which have been tried and tested on numerous courses, workshops and projects. We have
experimented with numerous accessories for the robots and the current design of the robots
encapsulates in their design our cumulative experience with teaching and deploying these robots.
      
      
      
       This is the first year that we are launching the national level E-yantra competition. This
competition aims to spread awareness about the best practices in robotics amongst all interested
engineering students. It aims to make robotics fun and practical and allow students to actually
apply their knowledge and solve a real life problem with the given hardware.
