Hi,

Here is the link to answer the <?php echo $this->lang->line('quiz');?>.

<?php echo $url; ?>

The <?php echo $this->lang->line('quiz');?> will not start immediately after clicking the link, you will be first presented the instruction and only then you may chose to answer the <?php echo $this->lang->line('quiz');?>.

However once you click 'Start <?php echo $this->lang->line('quiz');?>' button, you wont be able to pause and return back to the <?php echo $this->lang->line('quiz');?>.

Thanks and Regards

<?php echo base_url(); ?>
